## Overview
This is my second completed challenge for Frontend Mentor. I do these challenges as a way to solidify and enhance my front-end development skills, and as an opportunity to learn more about React, CSS, and accessibility best-practices.

For these challenges I am given JPGs of the final product, fonts, font sizes, and colors. I am not given exact dimensions so I have to guess those.
### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

## My process
- I have learned the value of a little bit of planning before diving into the code, so I planned out how I would initially structure my components before getting started. This changed slightly towards the end, but I think that's fine.
- I always put colored borders around my components to help visualize the box model.
- I started with desktop styles again, on the next challenge I will start with mobile styles
- I ran into a CSS snag and got some excellent advice from the Frontend Mentor community - toward the end I restrucred my components slightly based on the suggestions I received.

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- SCSS
- Flexbox
### What I learned
- Initially I structured the stats as a repeated component with different props. Based on a suggestion I received, I ended up changing the stats to an unordered list instead of . It's still essentially the same structure, but better semantics.
- The stat numbers were originally h2's, but I was told that h2's shouldn't be numbers, so I changed them to styled p tags.

### Continued development

Since this is only my second Frontend Mentor project, so as I do more of these I want to keep reinforcing fundamentals as I learn more about best practices. I will continue to use React and SCSS for a while, but I'll definitely start with mobile-first styling on my next challenge.
